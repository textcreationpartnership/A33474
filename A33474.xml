            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Chriſtian Reader.</head>
            <p>THis following Diſcourſe is preſented to thy Peruſal, under a double Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation, not only as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſo Evangelical a Bleſſing, (as the <hi>Peace of God</hi> in the Text) offer'd to thee; our heartiest endeavours for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, is ſo much our higheſt <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Importance, and Duty; but likewiſe more particularly the Occaſion that gave the Reverend Preacher the choice of this Text; which firſt in the plain matter of Fact take as follows.</p>
            <p>On the 3d. of <hi>February,</hi> 1691. about Three in the Afternoon, this Reverend Divine, a Perſon of the venerable Age of Eighty Years, and Forty of thoſe a Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Teacher of God's Word, in the Pariſh of <hi>Wigmore,</hi> in the County of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reford,</hi> being in the Hall of his own Houſe, being with the Pious Matron, his Wife, ſome Neighbours and Relations, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with two ſmall Grand-Children of
<pb facs="tcp:43372:3"/> his, in all to the number of Eight Perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Thomas Kinnerſley,</hi> one of the ſaid Grand-Children, of but Ten Years of Age, ſtarting up from the Fire-ſide, went out of the Hall-Door, and ſate himſelf down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Block, by a Wood-pile, before the Door, employing himſelf in no other Childiſh Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe than cutting of a Stick; when in leſs than half a quarter of an Hour, he returned into the Hall in great Amazement, his Countenance pale, and affrighted, and ſaid to his Grand father and Grand mother, <hi>Look in the Third of the</hi> Coloſſians, <hi>and the Fifteenth,</hi> with infinite Paſſion and Earneſtneſs, repeating the Words no leſs than three times; which Dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rtment and Speech much ſurprizing the whole Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they asked him what he meant by thoſe words; who anſwered with great Ardency of Spirit, That a <hi>Raven</hi> had ſpoken them Three times from the Peak of the Steeple and that it, look'd towards <hi>W. W.'s</hi> Houſe, and ſhook its <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Wings</hi> thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, directing its Looks and Motions ſtill towards that Houſe. All which words he heard the <hi>Raven</hi> diſtinctly utter three times, and then ſaw it mount and fly out of ſight. His Grand father hereupon, taking the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and turning to the ſaid Text, found theſe words.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:43372:3"/>
            <p>
               <hi>And let the Peace of God rule in your Hearts, to the which you are alſo called in one Body; and be ye thankful.</hi> Upon reading whereof, the Child was fully ſatisfied, and his Countenance perfectly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed agen.</p>
            <p>Now, as the Voice of a <hi>Ràven,</hi> to ſpeak in ſuch a marvellous manner, may ſeem an incredible Relation, eſpecially in an Age of ſuch little Faith, yet we do here of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer theſe ſerious Conſiderations for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of this real, though amazing Truth. Firſt, What may ſtagger ſome People, <hi>viz.</hi> That the greateſt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed only Authority in ſo weighty a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, is only from the Teſtimony of a Child, of but Ten Years old, is upon due and full Examination, one of the ſtrongeſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an undoubted Truth. For firſt, here were no leſs than Eight People, of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Credit and Reputation, that heard this Declaration of the Child, and were all Witneſſes and Obſervers, both of the Childs Countenance, Geſture and Behaviour in the whole thing. Now, tho' but a Child of no more than Ten Years, to come running from his Play, with ſo alter'd and changed a Countenance, and ſo much Vehemence of Spirit, and Earneſtneſs of Expreſſion to
<pb facs="tcp:43372:4"/> preſs an aged Grand-father and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother to ſo ſerious a work, as the ſearch of a particular Text of Scripture, had ſomething extraordinary in it.</p>
            <p>Now, had any Perſon of riper Years or any other ſingle Authority, come in the like manner, and with the ſame Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency, adviſed the Inquiry into ſuch a Text, and given any ſuch credible Relation of hearing a <hi>Raven</hi> ſpeak, here might have been ſome Grounds of Suſpicion in the Veracity of ſuch a ſingle Teſtimony; for at thoſe elder Years, the change of Face, and paſſion of Expreſſion, might poſſibly be Vizor and Artifice, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently afford matter of Doubt and Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Nay, poſſibly a Perſon of Maturity, as knowing the Fewds and Jarrs of the Family, towards which the <hi>Raven</hi> dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted this Text, might, even out of a good and honeſt deſign, have feigned ſuch a Relation, as thinking thereby to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled the long Diſunion and Diſcords of a Neighbour's Houſe, by ſo amazing a warning-piece for Peace and Concord, as coming from the Mouth of a <hi>Raven,</hi> tho' in reality a Fictitious ſtory. But in the caſe of a Boy, all this ſhadow of Doubt is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly removed; for, both the forementioned
<pb facs="tcp:43372:4"/> change of Countenance, and importunate Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, together with the Child's conſtant Aſſeveration of the Truth of this aſtoniſhing Accidents were all beyond the capacity of a Child, to feign or counterfeit; as being a Maſque, morally impoſſible for his young Face to wear: And not only ſo, but the matter and manner of his Delivery were Alien to his Years; for a poor Infant, then out of doors a whitling of a Stick, or ſome ſuch piece of innocent Childhood, to come running home on ſuch an important Errand, (as indeed no leſs than a Meſſage from God, take it in all the Circumſtances) was beyond the poſſibility of Art or Cunning. And moreover as a thing done at Noon-day, here was the plain and ſenſible Conviction, both of the Child's Eye and Ear in the caſe, and not as people in the Dark, many times frighted and Bug-bear'd into the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imaginary <hi>Chimeras</hi> and <hi>Fantoms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſum up the Evidences therefore; Here is poſſibly a full Teſtimony, even to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration it ſelf: And undoubtedly, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty was particularly pleaſed to deliver this unuſual Warning from Heaven, only to the Ear of a Child, that Innocence and Simplicity might be the greater and ſtronger Commiſſioner of his Divine Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, on ſuch an occaſion.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:43372:5"/>
            <p>Now, the Reaſons why this Reverend and Pious Divine has appeared thus in publick, and ſo long after (now above Two Years ſince) the thing was done, are theſe: As a modest ſober good Man, it never entred into his Thoughts of appearing in Print, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting himſelf, with doing his Duty to God, in teaching of his Flook at home, and preaching Christ, and him Crucified with in his own Precinct and Province, the care of thoſe Souls under his Tuition, being the ultimate of his VVork and Study, where accordingly he took occaſion to lay hold of ſo Heavenly an Admonition, and Preached to his Pariſhioners, on the very Text, ſo warn'd by the Voice of a <hi>Raven;</hi> but when in a remoter ſtation in the Country, he had underſtood that ſeveral little trivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Penny-Books and Ballads had been printed, and diſperſed here in <hi>London,</hi> giving a Narration of the ſaid wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing, and conſidered that ſo great a Truth was publiſhed in ſuch a manner hereupon, as he very well knew; how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Notorious Fictions, and Fooleries, are daily impoſed upon the VVorld in ſuch tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Pamphlets; (ſearce one in three truth) Therefore, to reſcue this ſerious Narration, from falling under Scandal and Reproach,
<pb facs="tcp:43372:5"/> from ſuch a Publication, as ſuch may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it doubted and ſuſpected, he perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelf, together with the prevailing importunity of Friends, to let this Diſcourſe of his, (contrary to his uſual modesty,) be made publick in the VVorld, as indeed, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in ſome meaſure to do ſome good <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Service therein, as far as lay in his Pow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>'Tis on this Account (Chriſtian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) that this following Diſcourſe is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to thy Hand, and under ſuch Creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, 'tis hoped (with the Grace of God) that the ſeaſonable Precepts contained therein, may be of Efficacy and Force, to work a lively ſenſe in thy Heart, of that juſt and high value we ought to ſet upon the <hi>Peace of God,</hi> here offered by the Apoſtle to thy moſt earneſt ſeeking and deſire: And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, though this Voice of a <hi>Raven,</hi> thus Commiſſion'd from above, in the utterance of ſuch a Heavenly Admonition, ſeemed to direct his ſtupendious Language, to a particular private Family, (which Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Family, through God's great Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Mercy, have ſince received the wonderful effects of the ſaid <hi>Heavenly Admonition,</hi> being all reconciled and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a moſt perfect Love and Amity,) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<pb facs="tcp:43372:6"/> the purport of that Language, ſo marvellous in our Ears, had a further and larger Extent, as being indeed a general A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakning Alarm to all Mankind, Union and Concord, being the faireſt and largeſt Branches of that greateſt of our Divine Apoſtolical Inſtructions, Charity. Moſt certainly this wondrous Warning piece, though more immediately pointing to a ſingle Family, was intended for an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Call, and Thou and We, and all the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, are thus called by a gracious God (from the higheſt to the loweſt, from the Cottage to the Throne,) to Unity and Love, as the effectual means of attaining the Peace of God, which is the Fundamental and Baſis of our Happineſs, both in this VVorld, and the VVorld to come, the Bleſſing both of Heaven and Earth.</p>
            <p>As ſuch therefore, (kind <hi>Reader)</hi> be pleaſed to accept it; and if it may be any ways inſtrumental towards that great end, the obtaining the <hi>Peace of God</hi> to thy Soul, the Author has his Labour more than rewarded. <hi>And ſo Farewel.</hi>

            <p>THeſe Words (well Beloved in our Lord) have ever ſince run in my Mind, ſince we were in ſo unuſual and miraculous a manner dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted unto them, by the <hi>unſearchable wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> that doth nothing in an extraordinary way, but for moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Ends and Purpoſes: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the more I have thought of them, the more Difficulties have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves unto me, inſomuch that I have endeavoured to remove my Thoughts from them, to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place; yet I know not how, I have been ſtill rowled back to them again: for to uſe the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>They were in mine heart as a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire ſhut up in my bones, and I was
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43372:7"/> weary with forbearing, and I could not ſtay,</hi> Jer. 20. 9.</p>
            <p>I reſolved at length, to make them the ground of my Speech to you at this time, which the Lord grant may be with as much profit to you all, as both I bring deſire unfeigned, and the Scripture it ſelf affords occaſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And that indeed is very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in many regards.</p>
            <p>They are firſt the words of God, not only as all other holy Scripture, from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſpiration, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 26. in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſort, the words of holy men, yea, of wicked men, yea, of wicked Spirits them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, at leaſt, as far forth as to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital of them, are the words of God; but theſe of my Text have been point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at of late, by a new Inſpiration from God in the Mouth of a Raven, in a diſtinct and audible Voice. He that ſpake of old from Heaven on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> in the ſight and hearing of all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> hath commanded us to look ſeriouſly into this Scripture. If <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to King <hi>Agrippa, That he was not diſobedient unto the heavenly viſion, Acts</hi> 26. 19. Why ſhould I or you be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to the heavenly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Voice of this Text? and not ſay with the <hi>Pſalmiſt,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43372:7"/> I will hear what God the Lord will ſpeak, for he will ſpeak peace unto his people, and to his Saints,</hi> Pſalm 85. 8. (Never more neceſſary than in this Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Age) but let them not <hi>turn again to folly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now becauſe this Voice came not becauſe of me, or the Childs ſake only that heard it, but for your ſakes alſo, and for <hi>all that are a far off,</hi> Iſa. 57. 19. that are concerned with us in this <hi>peace of God,</hi> I will endeavour to look into, and open this Scripture unto you, that all that have an Ear to hear, may hear with Reverence, what the <hi>Spirit of God ſpeaks to the Churches</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 3. 19. Rev. 2. 17.</note> in it; that we may not let it <hi>fall to the ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> hath in his Entrance to entreat upon this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> ſeems to me not untruly, nor unfitly ſaid: Theſe <hi>Epiſtles</hi> which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> writeth out of Priſon, (ſuch as are to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> whereto this hath won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful likeneſs to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to <hi>Philemon,</hi> the 2d. to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>) have I know not what, more than ordinary Portion of the Power of <hi>Pauls Spirit</hi> appearing in them; 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe he was now come near to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43372:8"/> the end of his Life, and ſo the Graces of God's Spirit in him to perfection. Or 2. that <hi>Afflictions</hi> have a ſpecial power to enlarge our hearts, and make them apt for heavenly Exerciſes; (as indeed the Truth never thrives better than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Croſs.) Or 3. that the <hi>Auditor</hi> now conceives <hi>Paul,</hi> (as the ſame <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> ſpeaks) like a noble Conquerour, Inditing or Writing amidſt his ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd Enemies, amidſt his Trophies, the durable Monuments of his Glory:</p>
            <p>Now, if you pleaſe, I will add a word or two, touching the <hi>Argument,</hi> or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſcope of this whole <hi>Epistle,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to the particular handling of the <hi>Words of the Text</hi> It may appearby that which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> writes in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter</hi> and <hi>first Verſe,</hi> that theſe <hi>Coloſſians</hi> were not Converted by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He writes thus: <hi>For I would that ye knew what great Conflict I have for you, and for them of</hi> Laodicea, <hi>and for as many as have not ſeen my face in the fleſh:</hi> They were then Converted by the Miniſtery of ſome other, poſſible by <hi>Epaphras,</hi> whoſe Preaching he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>verſe</hi> 7th. of the Firſt Chapter; <hi>as ye alſo learned of</hi> Epaphras <hi>our dear fellow ſervant, who is for you a faithful
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43372:8"/> Miniſter of Chriſt.</hi> Yet (the common caſe of all the Churches at that time and almoſt of all times alike) <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> left no Stone unmoved to diſturb them, and corrupt the Truth they had received, with Men's Traditions and Inventions; ſo hard a thing it is to keep us to the Simplicity that is in <hi>Christ Jeſus,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3.</p>
            <p>The <hi>evil Seeds</hi> that were ſcattered by his <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>curioſity</hi> of his <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> were thoſe about <hi>Meats,</hi> Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Days, worſhiping of Angels,</hi> and the like: whereof in the latter end of the Second Chapter. The <hi>Apostle</hi>'s purpoſe then in this <hi>Epistle,</hi> is, to recal them firſt to Chriſt, and his ſufficiency of Redemption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, To ſtir up their minds to the practice of the duties of <hi>Love,</hi> and the ſhewing the fruits of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> unto which two Heads this whole <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle</hi> (ſetting the wonted Complements of Salutation, Entrance and Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aſide,) may fully be reduced. Now ſince we know the general Scope of the <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> let us come to theſe words that were read even now, and their Connexion with the foregoing.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:43372:9"/>
            <p>The <hi>Apostle</hi> in the 12th <hi>verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chapter,</hi> with courteous and alluring language, in the terms which he gives theſe <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> ſtyling them, <hi>The Elect of God, holy and beloved;</hi> and that which hereby he would work them to, commends unto them ſundry and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Duties of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and hath opened a rich Wardrobe of certain <hi>Excellent Vertues</hi> to put on, and cloth our ſelves withal, as parts of <hi>Sanctification. Put on</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>bowels of mercies, kindneſs, bumbleneſs of mind, meekneſs, long-ſuffering:</hi> Five Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties near of affinity together; the laſt whereof, <hi>long-ſuffering,</hi> he ſets forth by two acts of it, and by the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Pattern out of which it is taken, <hi>verſe 13. Forbearing one another, forgiving one another; if any man have a quarrel againſt any, even as Chriſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave you, ſo do ye.</hi> Which words of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> do to us declare, That our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, as always, ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently in his <hi>Paſſion</hi> was thus clad and inveſted; a great inducement to us, to like either the <hi>Stuff</hi> or <hi>Faſhion,</hi> whoſe whole Life ought to be an Imitation of ſo great an <hi>Author,</hi> as he ſpeaks; <hi>For I have given you an example, that you
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43372:9"/> ſhould do, as I have done to you,</hi> John 13. <hi>v.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> hath not yet done, but perſiſts in the ſame <hi>Argument</hi> in the 14, and 15 <hi>verſes,</hi> which are a Declaration of the formerly mentioned Duties of <hi>meekneſs and long-ſuffering,</hi> wherein (you ſee) are contained <hi>three Vertues</hi> more exhorted unto, <hi>Love, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,</hi> verſe 14. <hi>Love;</hi> and above all theſe things, <hi>put on Charity which is the bond of perfectneſs.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Beſides all the former (as continuing in the manner of ſpeaking, taken from Apparel) aloft over all theſe, as an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Garment, <hi>put on Love which is the bond of perfectneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in the 15th <hi>verſe</hi> which I have read unto you, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> calls the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> to <hi>two Duties</hi> of <hi>Sanctification, Peace</hi> and <hi>Thankfulneſs:</hi> and firſt, of <hi>Peace,</hi> an Argument always worthy to entertain us, the very Name whereof is ſweet, the thing it ſelf not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, but healthful, ſweeter than <hi>honey and the honey-comb,</hi> including all good, by Scripture-uſe, and all Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that God will beſtow upon his People, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> concludes the 29th <hi>Pſalm; He will bleſs his people with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43372:10"/> peace, all happineſs, outward ſucceſs, and proſperity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the Senſe and meaning of theſe words, that we may proceed on good ground, and the better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the whole Order and Web of the Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Peace of God,</hi> here ſpoken of, is not properly, <hi>Peace with God,</hi> Luke. 19. 38. whereof the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Rom. 5. v. 1. Therefore being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> and John 14. <hi>v. 27. Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth, give I it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</hi> But peace with men, which we are bidden to hold withal, if it may be, <hi>Rom. 12. ver. 18. If it be poſſible, as much as in you lyeth, live peaceably with all men.</hi> The peace one with another, which he would have us to keep, as <hi>Heb. 12. 14. Follow peace with all men, and holineſs, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord:</hi> and, <hi>Be at peace among your ſelves,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 13.</p>
            <p>But yet it is called <hi>God's peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe he is the <hi>Author</hi> of it; for God is not the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>Sedition,</hi> but of <hi>Peace, as in all the Churches of the Saints,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 33. and 2 Theſſ. 3. 16.</p>
            <p n="2">

            <p>Thus I have briefly ſearched into the inward Reaſons of Diſſentions, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures hath laid them before us.</p>
            <p>2. The outward Reaſons of them, are; 1. <hi>Satan</hi> the old Serpent, that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43372:15"/> 
               <hi>kept not his firſt ſtation,</hi> Jude 6. but brake his own peace with God in Heaven, and ours with our God in Paradiſe, and ever ſince with one another, that ſlips no occaſion to ſow the <hi>Tares of diſſention in the Lord's field;</hi> and <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes the Woman that brought forth the Man-child,</hi> Rev. 12. 13. 17. as hotly as ever, becauſe he knoweth that he hath but a <hi>ſhort time between him and the Lake</hi> (ſpoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 14.) to break the peace, and hinder her proſperity; <hi>By making war with the remnant of her ſeed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> the things that ſhall come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him and his followers <hi>make haſte, Deut.</hi> 32. 35.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Wicked men ſet on by <hi>Satan,</hi> to ſet us together by the ears, that they may weaken us by our own powers. The Church had ſometimes reſt from her <hi>Paganiſh Enemies</hi> and <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> but never from her own <hi>Children that ſhe had nouriſhed and brought up, yet they rebelled asainſt her,</hi> Iſa. 1. 2. That came to her in <hi>Sheeps-clothing,</hi> but inwardly they were <hi>Ravening Wolves;</hi> as our Lord deſcribes them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 15. Such were the <hi>Arians</hi> of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:43372:15"/> old, whoſe Diviſions and Cruelties exceeded the <hi>Paganiſh,</hi> as much as the <hi>Popiſh</hi> exceed all that were before them in <hi>Malice, Hatred,</hi> and <hi>Cruelty</hi> towards God's People; of which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> gave warning to the Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> ſaying, <hi>For I know that after my departing, ſhall grievous Wolves enter in among you, not ſparing the flock; and alſo of your own ſelves ſhall men ariſe ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw away Diſciples after them,</hi> Acts 20. 29, 30. And again, he would have <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> to know, <hi>that in the laſt days peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous times ſhould come;</hi> which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes ſo exactly, as if he had lived in our days to behold them, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. verſe 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>The next Obſervation from theſe words, is this;</q>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. That the <hi>Peace of God</hi> ruling in the hearts of Believers, is the only remedy againſt all <hi>Diſſentions,</hi> inward and outward, which is here called, <hi>God's peace,</hi> for theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. For indeed he, and he alone, it is, that makes men to be of one <hi>mind together, Rom. 15. 5. 2 Cor.</hi> 13. 11. the work of <hi>godly union,</hi> is the Prerogative of God; according to the Name that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:43372:16"/> 
               <hi>Gideon</hi> gave to the <hi>Altar</hi> that he built in <hi>Ophrah,</hi> when he was made Captain General againſt the <hi>Midianites,</hi> he called it <hi>Jehovah Shalem,</hi> that is, the <hi>God of peace;</hi> or, <hi>the Lord ſend peace,</hi> which he did grant his people for forty years, after the defeat of their invading, and preſumptuous Enemies, by the <hi>Sword of the Lord, and the Sword of</hi> Gideon, <hi>Judg.</hi> 6. 24. and Chap. 8. 28.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe it is God alone that makes the Enemies to be at peace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with thoſe that he loves; as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſpeaks, Prov. 16. 8. <hi>When a man's ways pleaſe the Lord, he maketh even his Enemies to be at peace with him. I make peace, ſaith the Lord,</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Chap. 47. 7.</p>
            <p>3. He is termed by the Name of, <hi>The God of peace,</hi> Prov. 15. 15. Not only in reſpect of the giving ſpiritual peace of Conſcience, which is a continual Feaſt, but this inward peace of Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and outward carriage towards others; as our <hi>Apoſtle</hi> concludes his <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> (among whom there had been <hi>many Diſſentions and Contentions,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 11.) <hi>Finally
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:43372:16"/> my brethren farewel, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace, and the God of love and peace ſhall be with you,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 11.</p>
            <p>4. Laſtly, he is called, <hi>The God of peace,</hi> not only eſſentially, but alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſ.</hi> 3. God in the unity of Eſſence, and Trinity of Perſons, is the God of peace; there is a moſt bleſſed and eternal peace between them.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="3">3. God the Son, the ſecond Perſon in the bleſſed Trinity, is alſo ſtyled, <hi>the God of peace,</hi> as the Deſerver of all that is to be given us, and Beſtower, who by Office and Authority, is able to diſpence from the Father unto us his Subjects, ſuch things as we have need of, whereof <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> are the chief Jewels. (as verſe 2. of the firſt Chapter.) The <hi>Syriack</hi> reads this Text thus, <hi>Let the peace of Chriſt rule in your hearts:</hi> He is <hi>our peace,</hi> ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Micah</hi> 5. 5. and this man ſhall be the <hi>peace,</hi> when the <hi>Aſſyrian ſhall tread in our land:</hi> The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> calls him <hi>the Prince of peace,</hi> Iſa. 9. 6. as typified by <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> King of <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> the <hi>true King of peace;</hi> as the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> renders his Royal Titles, firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng by interpretation <hi>King of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>

            <p>He is our Peace-maker with God; <hi>Being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 5. 1. At his Birth all the Militia of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſang this joyful Ditty in a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Peace; <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt, peace on earth, good will towards men,</hi> Luke 2, 14. At his Death he left us a Legacy of peace; <hi>My peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth I give unto you,</hi> John 14. 27.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God the Holy Ghoſt, the third Perſon of the glorious Trinity, is the <hi>God of peace,</hi> the Spirit of peace and love: <hi>And the very God of peace ſanctifie you wholly;</hi> the concluſion of the Firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians, ch. 5. ver.</hi> 23.

            <p>And becauſe the God head and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiality of the Son with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is by all this diſcourſe approved, and that alſo of the Holy Ghoſt; I will conclude this Point after the phraſe of the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> Creed; <hi>The Father is the God of peace, the Son is the God of peace, and the Holy Ghoſt is the God of peace; and yet they are not three Gods of peace, but one God of peace:</hi> And with that Prayer wherewith the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> concludes his Second Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> which includes all this; <hi>Now the Lord of peace himſelf give you peace always, by all means; the Lord be with you all.</hi> 2 Theſſ. 3. v. 16.</p>

In the brief Application of this Point, before I proceed any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let us obſerve, for our Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That this is a cloſe Argument, to perſwade the more, to permit this Peace to hold the Maſtery in us, becauſe it
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43372:18"/> is God's, and ſo indeed God ſhall rule in our hearts by his peace.</p>
            <p>The name of the <hi>King's Peace,</hi> is of no ſmall weight, as to repreſs the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the Unruly; It ought to be at leaſt, when the Officer cries, <hi>I charge you in the King's Name, to keep the King's Peace.</hi> God's Sacred Name is greater, that is <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords;</hi> the greater their Sin that break his Peace, at once offending God and the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Exhort.</hi> Let us not ſay then, we will not have his Peace rule in our hearts; as thoſe Ill-bred Citizens, that hated their Noble Lord, and ſent a Meſſage after him, ſaying, <hi>We will not have this man to rule over us,</hi> Luke 19. 14. but rather as the men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaid to <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon, Rule thou over us, both thou and thy ſon, and thy ſon's ſon alſo, for thou haſt delivered us from the hand of</hi> Midi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Judg. 8. 22. <hi>And hath made peace in our borders;</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſings, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 147. 14.</p>

            </p>
            <p>For the meaning whereof, it is as much as to ſay, As God, when he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere you from the World, would lay this task upon you, <hi>to have peace rule in you;</hi> for this was the Prophecy of <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah,</hi> concerning the times of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> that cruel and ſavage Beaſts ſhould lay down their fierceneſs, Lions, Wolves, Serpents, learn other manners, and become at unity with Lambs, Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This purpoſe of God, you muſt become Inſtruments to bring to paſs. <hi>The Wolf alſo ſhall dwell with the Lamb, and the Leopard ſhall lye down with the Kid, the Calf and the young Lion, and the Fatling together, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Child ſhall lead them; and the Cow and the Bear ſhall feed, their young ones ſhall lye down together, and the Lion ſhall eat Straw like the Ox, and the ſucking Child ſhall play on the hole of the Aſp, and the weaned child ſhall put his hand on the Cookatrice den; they ſhall not hunt nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy

            <p>A great ſhame for a Miniſter of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace, to break the peace: A Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, who is the Conſervator of the Peace, or a Conſtable, who is ſworn to ſee the Peace kent, to be a Fighter, or maker of Frays: Penal it is in a high degree, when a man is bound to the Peace, to be a Striker.

Now I beſeech you brethren, by the Name of our Lord Jeſus Christ, that ye all ſpeak the ſame thing, and that there be no diviſion among you, that ye be perfectly joyned together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgment.</hi>

            <p>Firſt, Who, and what we are, and were? Our Lord reſolveth this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, chiefly in his Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Laodicea; Becauſe thou ſayeſt, I am rich and encreaſed with goods, and have need of nothing; and knoweſt not that thou art

                  </gap>ſt be rich, and white rayment that thou mayest be cloathed, and that the ſhame of thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs do not appear, and anoint thine eyes with eye-ſalve, that thou mayeſt ſee,</hi> Rev. 3. v. 17. 18.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Who it is that calls us?</p>
            <p>When our Lord commanded blind <hi>Bartimeus</hi> to be called, that cried after him, <hi>Jeſus thou ſon of</hi> David, <hi>have mercy on me:</hi> And they call the blind man, ſaying unto him, <hi>be of good comfort, riſe, he calleth thee; and he caſting away his garment, roſe and came to Jeſus,</hi> Mark 10. 50. So ought we to caſt away all our Animoſities and petty Diſſentions, and admit this ſweet and eaſie Yoak, of the <hi>Peace of God to rule in our hearts; for faithful is he that calleth you, who alſo will do it,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle, 1 Theſſ.</hi> 5. 24. And again, <hi>God is faithful, by whom ye are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto the fellowſhip of his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle Peter, 1. 2. 9. 2. From the dominion of ſin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, unto the glorious liberty of the children of God,</hi> Rom. 8. 21. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1. From the troubles of this tumultuous World, that is like the raging Sea, that cannot reſt,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43372:21"/> and the Chriſtians are as weary of it, as <hi>David</hi> was of <hi>Meſek;</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>Wo is me that I ſojourn in</hi> Meſek, <hi>that I dwell in the Tents of</hi> Kedar; <hi>my Soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace: I am for peace, but when I ſpeak, they are for war.</hi> And again he ſaid, <hi>O that I had wings like a Dove, for then would I flye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and be at reſt,</hi> Pſalm 55. v. 6. Upon which account, our Lord calleth his Church from the World, the Seat of cruel men, to Heaven, in theſe endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſſions; <hi>Come with me from</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon, <hi>my Spouſe, with me from</hi> Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non; <hi>lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k from the top of</hi> Amana, <hi>from the top of</hi> Shema <hi>and</hi> Harmon, <hi>from the Lions Den, from the Mountain of the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards,</hi> Cant. 4. 9.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Unto what are we called? God hath called us unto peace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 15. Let our Calling admoniſh us of our Duty: We are called unto Peace, ſaith this Text alſo. <hi>Peace, peace, to him that is afar off, and to him that is near, ſaith the Lord, and I will heal him,</hi> Iſa. 57. 19. <hi>Knowing this, that we are thereunto called, that we ſhould inherit a bleſſing,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter:</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 9. And what greater bleſſing than peace, that in the bowels of it hath all bleſſings lodged: And our
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43372:21"/> 
               <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us above Sixteen hundred years ago, <hi>That the God of peace ſhall bruiſe Satan</hi> (the grand Enemy of our peace) <hi>under our feet ſhortly,</hi> Rom. 26. v. 20. <hi>That we may know in this our day, the things that belong to our peace, that they be not hid from our eyes;</hi> as our Lord ſpake when he wept over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Luke 19. 42.</p>
            <p>I will conclude this firſt Reaſon, Why the peace of God ſhould bear rule in our hearts: Becauſe we are called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, with our Lords charge to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, in bidding them, <hi>Beware of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences:</hi> He concludes his Speech thus; <hi>Have ſalt in your ſelves, and have peace on with another,</hi> Mark 9. 42. 50. Where the Salt of true Grace is, it will make the means of peace ſweet and ſavoury, and no ſtain of corruption, or the leaſt unſavourineſs ſhall remain, to diſreliſh any ſqueamiſh Stomach. Let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber withal, That he that is the God of peace, that hath called us to peace, is alſo the God of all grace, <hi>Who hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led us unto his eternal glory by Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, 1 Pet. 5. 10. <hi>And ſo an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance ſhall be miniſtred unto us abundantly into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. v. 1 1
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43372:22"/> where we ſhall enjoy everlaſting peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. The ſecond Reaſon why the peace of God ſhould rule in our hearts, is this; That we are in one body.</p>
            <p>For that this is a diſtinct Reaſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, becauſe he ſays, Not unto our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in one body. This Similitude more fully, is, as much as to ſay, You Chriſtians with Chriſt make as it were a body: Therefore as it were monſtrous, if one body ſhould yield members fighting one againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and making as it were a civil war in the natural body. So it is, if diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order be found amongſt you Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that which Chriſt makes up a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical body. The reſembling Chriſtians to a body, is at large exemplified and garniſhed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and in divers other places of Scripture mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Val. Max.</hi> Flor. tit. 1.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:43372:22"/> unto them; <q>
                  <hi>At what time,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>in man's Body, the Members did not as now agree in one, but each had his ſeveral counſel and ſpeech, the rest of the parts had indignation, that by their care, labour, and induſtry, and miniſtry, all things were provided for the Belly, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quiet and at eaſe, in the midſt; did nought elſe but enjoy the Pleaſures that were given it: Whereupon they conſpired, that the Hand ſhould not reach any meat to the Mouth, nor the Mouth receive it, being given, nor the Teeth chew it. Whilſt thus enraged, they would needs maſter the Belly with Famine: The Members them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves withal, and the whole Body came to an extream Conſumption, whereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared that the Bellies Service was not the worſt, nor ſlackeſt, that it did not leſs nouriſh than receive nouriſhment, yielding back into all the parts, the life and blood, which having digeſted the meat, it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth thereout, and divideth withal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Veins and Conduits of the whole Body: Such,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is the Civil Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and Anger of the People againſt the Senate.</hi>
               </q>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ace. And indeed the <hi>Apoſtle's</hi> Speech, <hi>If ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not conſumed one of another,</hi> Gal. 5. 25. tends to the ſame end; and largely doth he garniſh this Similitude in the place I named right now, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to divers Duties, which ſhortly to name, becauſe they ſerve to the maintenance of Peace in her Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, are theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. To rejoyce each at others good; <hi>If one member be honoured, all the members rejoyce with it,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 26.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſuffer Compaſſionately each with other: <hi>And whether one member ſuffer, all the members ſuffer with it,</hi> ibid.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To have Care each of another; <hi>That there ſhould be no ſchiſm in the body, but that the members ſhould have the ſame care one of another</hi> (v. 25.) to nouriſh and cheriſh them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The more weak and baſe, to be compaſſed with Honour, with the more comely; Nay much more, thoſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body that ſeem more feeble, are neceſſary: and thoſe members of the body which we think to be baſe, upon thoſe we beſtow more abundant honour; <hi>and our uncomely parts have
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:43372:23"/> more abundant comelineſs,</hi> verſe 22, 23.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The worthier not to think they may be without the baſer, nor the baſer think they are not in any place or reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning, becauſe not the worthieſt. <hi>And the Eye cannot ſay to the Hand, I have no need of thee;</hi> nor again, <hi>the Hand to the Foot, I have no need of you,</hi> v. 2.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If the Foot ſhall ſay, <hi>becauſe I am not the Hand, I am not of the body, is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not of the body? And if the Ear ſhall ſay, becauſe I am not the Eye, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body?</hi> v. 15. 26.</p>
            <p>Thus far the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in his excellent Parallel between the Members of the Natural Body, and the Members of the Body Myſtical. Theſe Opinions and Practices befit ſuch as would keep peace, ſuch as are Members of one Body; which very Conſideration, that they are found in the Natural Body, ſhould draw us into the practice of them, in the Spiritual and Myſtical: Chriſt our Lord flows into us by his Spirit of Peace and Love, and gives us Grace ſo to do, and this will enable us to obey the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> in the words before this Text. <hi>And above all things, put on charity which is the bond of perfectneſs.</hi> This word <hi>Bond,</hi> is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:43372:24"/> taken ſometimes for the <hi>Sinews</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments</hi> of the <hi>Joynts,</hi> as <hi>Chap. 2. v.</hi> 19. Sometimes for the Band that tieth a thing, compoſed of a great many ſmall parts into one; as a Sheaf or Faggot. ſo I think <hi>Peace</hi> is called, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 3. en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to keep <hi>the unity of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the bond of Peace.</hi> And this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectneſs may be taken, 1. For the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectneſs of every man in the Gifts of the Spirit, which are diſſolved, and fall one from another, without Love. Or, 2ly. For the whole Body of the Church, which is diſſolved and falls aſunder without love; of which in the two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces laſt named. I will include herein, both inward perfectneſs in private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and publick in the body of the Church. So the Church, Chriſt's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it is capable of a kind of perfection, even when it is moſt imperfect in the Eyes of the World; as now it was, and when the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> wrote that, <hi>Epheſians 4. v.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſervat.</hi> The thing that makes the Perfection of the Church, is Love. He therefore that loves not, is imperfect in Chriſtianity: A Child in Grace, (if he have any) yet is Carnal, not Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; a Babe, not a Man; as the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:43372:24"/> concludes of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> from hence, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 1. 3. And thoſe that take no care to maintain Love with their even Chriſtians, they do as much as they may, maim, lame, and make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect the Body of Chriſt, laying aſide his new Commandment, <hi>That ye love one another, as I have loved you,</hi> John 13. 34. Let <hi>Papiſts</hi> and ſuch as rejoyce in bitterneſs againſt their Brethren, think on this: Let us learn by all means to maintain Peace and Love; the untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breaking of ſome Truth, is not worth ſo much as to break Love; As the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of ſome Diſeaſe, not worth the pain of the Cure; as of ſome Wens and Warts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> worth the cutting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this is to be followed of us. It is more than ſeaſonable, that we were put in mind of this Point, for we are faulty in it much: Now if one be more ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous than another, in Ceremonies and Matters indifferent, Miniſter, or other; one ſort there is that preſently abate their love. Again, if another take a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle liberty in ſuch things, the other ſide bears not that hearty affection which ſhould be unto him; Though thus ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther think of the other, they are men that intend to do vertuouſly, yet there
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:43372:25"/> is not this equal Communication of the Offices of Kindneſs, which this Form, <hi>Above all things put on love,</hi> would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. What if men diſſent from us in ſundry Points of Judgment or of Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as both may be, and juſtly; yet let the Conſideration, that they are Members of the ſame Body with us, Men reclaimed to God; Men, which according to that which they know, endeavour to Serve and Worſhip God, makes us to ſtrive ſo much the more, that it might not ſeem to come through our Default, that any Strangers ſhould be between us; or Differences grow to greater Extremities, we ſhall have the better in the handling of the Cauſe; to ſay nothing of the Truth, whether we have it on our ſide or no. I would to God that we could be content in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of no great Conſequence, when many Differences be among us, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe them with that of the <hi>Apoſtle; If any man think otherwiſe, the Lord ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal this alſo unto you,</hi> Phil. 3. 15. And in the mean ſpace, in our Speeches, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, Geſtures, Writings, be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of this ſtanding Rule, <hi>That Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to all the Saints;</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes theſe <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> by <hi>their Faith in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:43372:25"/> Jeſus Chriſt, and their Love to all the Saints,</hi> Chap. 1. 4. So by letting go vain Clamours, we ſhall find more Truth than we do, as being better diſpoſed to ſeek it, (which indeed no paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate man is;) and ſure I am, we ſhould have more peace and comfort, and be freed from much fooliſh Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions among our ſelves, and many ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous and foul Imputations from our common Enemies. God give us Grace to ſee our Faults, &amp; put a Remedy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in time, before by our Diſſentions, we have weakened our ſelves; that both together, we be not matchable to our third and worſt Adverſary; ſee <hi>Pſalm</hi> 133.</p>
            <q>And be ye thankful.</q>
            <p>The ſecond Duty we are exhorted unto in this Scripture, is <hi>the duty of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs;</hi> what variety is between theſe two Words, <hi>Amiable</hi> and <hi>Thankful;</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man may at the firſt view eaſily conceive. But our lateſt Tranſlation of the Word is the beſt, that for <hi>Amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> puts in <hi>Thankful,</hi> whereunto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the Word, and Authority of other Interpreters doth ſo lead me; as

               <hi>Q. What is the thankfulneſs that is here required?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>R.</hi> It may be deſcribed, <hi>a willing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging and readineſs to requite Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, and good Turns received.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I did not ſay, <hi>a Requital,</hi> for many times there is no Power or Means ſo to do, but at leaſt there is Readineſs to do it, and Mind of the good Turn; if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe fail, there is a Defect in <hi>Thankfulneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The occaſion of <hi>Thankfulneſs,</hi> is a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit received, (the greater Benefit calls more Thanks) which hath diverſity from the Perſon.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:43372:26"/>1. Sometimes we are wholly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in receiving, before we have ſhewed any occaſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sometimes again we are firſt in ſome Office, but are exceeded in the anſwering the ſame.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sometimes the Perſons are Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors or Equals; of ſuch quality I mean, as there is no great odds between the Donor and Receiver.</p>
            <p>To the Firſt and Second of each, <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> is the more to be ſhewed; I mean, we are more beholding, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as there is leſs deſert on our part, and in the one, nothing at all.</p>
            <q>I would ſpeak plainly.</q>
            <p n="1">1. To our <hi>Parents, Miniſters,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in Learning;</hi> there is no Office we could ſhew to deſerve <hi>Kindneſs,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to them we muſt be more bound to be <hi>thankful:</hi> So to a Stranger that ſhall firſt upon ſome acquaintance, no expectation of Requital, beſtow only upon us, in the ſame meaſure of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, our Debt is more, than to one that we have, or may be helpful, or ſhew duty to again.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To our Superiour, being kind, we owe more gratitude, than to our Equal; as <hi>Iſhboſheth David, 2 Sam.</hi> 19. 30. 28.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:43372:27"/>3. Even the Value of the Benefit, adds ſome degree unto our Debt of Thankfulneſs, moſt, our ſelves; as <hi>Paul</hi> writes to <hi>Philemon, v. 19. Albeit I do not ſay unto thee, how thou oweſt unto me, even thine own ſelf beſides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. And the Speedineſs ſometimes adds to our Debt, eſpecially if it be at the firſt knowledge of our Want or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and perhaps expects not our moving the Matter, or if at our Suit, be given undelaiedly; <hi>Beneficium qui cito dat bis dat,</hi> He gives twice that gives ſpeedily.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But moſt of our debt of Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs comes from the Mind of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, as proceeding from greater Love, though there be, by reaſon of want of power, leſs worth in the good Turn.</p>
            <p>
               <q>We are then to be taught here:</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doctr.</hi> That to all thoſe that have been Inſtruments of God's Providence to procure good unto us, we are to owe Thankfulneſs; they are ſo many Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of God to us. That which the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> once affirmed before <hi>Solomon,</hi> is very true: The Inſtruments of God's Bleſſings, are the Arguments of his Love to us; <hi>Becauſe the Lord loved</hi> Iſrael <hi>for War, therefore made he the King to do Judgment and Juſtice,</hi> 1 Kings 10. 9.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:43372:27"/>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt duty of Thankfulneſs that under God we owe, is to our Parents; which is ſo neceſſary, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> would not have the <hi>Widows to be choſen to the ſervice of the Church,</hi> that had Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to maintain them, and perform duty to them: <hi>Let them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence their Anceſtors;</hi> (So the Word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>The ſecond part of Ingratitude is the worſt: To requite Evil for Good, the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> crys out againſt this, with a grievous cry, and a bitter, <hi>Shall evil be recompenced for good?</hi> Jer. 18. 20. as a monſtrous piece of Ingratitude. <hi>Who ſo rewards evil for good</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) evil ſhall not depart from his houſe,</hi> Prov. 17. 13.

            <p>There is not any other fault more generally blamed, even by thoſe that have but the Light of Nature, than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude (as I have largely ſhewed) nor any Ingratitude greater than to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, becauſe of none we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more, or greater Benefits than from him: to ſay nothing, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſſible, that we ſhould attain to that degree of Thankfulneſs, which ſhould be in requiting the Benefits, we daily and hourly receive of him; he is contented to take the Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them for Payment, ſo as it muſt be the effect of a moſt Villa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Men are not ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to this <hi>Duty of Thankfulneſs</hi> as they ought; ſo it is, to Prayer we are more ready, as being ſenſible of our wants; not to Thankſgiving, as having them furniſhed, and ſo now in good caſe. This appears in the Goſpel, in the ten Lepers, one only of which returned after his cleanſing, to give Thanks, though nine intreated cleanſing. <hi>And Jeſus anſwering, ſaid, Were there not ten cleanſed, but where are the nine?

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43372:35"/> Superiours by Authority, Equals and Inferiours by Perſuaſion, all by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: See the practice; <hi>Sing praiſes unto the Lord, ye Saints of his, and give Thanks at the remembrance of his holineſs.</hi> Pſal. 30. 4. And again; <hi>O magnifie the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together; Come ye Children, hearken unto me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</hi> Pſal. 34. 3. 11. Yea, ſo far is this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of gratitude towards God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as the very Angels, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures are invited to this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as the 103, and 148 <hi>Pſalms</hi> ſhew throughout.</p>
            <p>Whether becauſe company increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth courage in us in any work, or elſe we would ſhew, that we account our own endeavour too little, and too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective; whence we deſire that which we lack, others with us ſhould help to ſupply. This is alſo wonderfully well fitting to our natural Inclination; for Man is a Sociable Creature, and loves company, even in civil life: wicked men are companions in evil, and ſay, <hi>Come with us, let us lay wait for blood; let us lurk privily for the innocent with out a cauſe.</hi> Prov. 1. 11. And how much more in the higheſt Acts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:43372:36"/> wherein our life is beſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, ought God's Saints to do the like?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here then are we to be encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the ſolemn Worſhip of God, (which is altogether Euchariſtical,) to frequent thoſe Aſſemblies, yea, and privately to encourage, and ſtir up one another, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks; <hi>Not forſaking the aſſembling of our ſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the manner of ſome is, but exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one another, and ſo much the more as ye ſee the day approaching.</hi> Heb. 10. 25.

            <p n="2">2. On the other ſide, here is blamed the backwardneſs of thoſe that even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited and encouraged, yea, enforced in a manner, by Authority, refuſe to come to give Thanks to the Lord, in a Service of God, wherein themſelves can find nothing to blame, unleſs that it is underſtood, and not ſtanding in an unknown Tongue, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a dry and fruitleſs Devotion: The

All company that truly fears God, is good; and if not in our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, Where have they either lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that he is to be praiſed, or found thoſe great benefits of His, whereupon they acknowledge, that they are bound to praiſe Him, and to give Thanks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to His Holy Name for them?</p>
            <p n="4">4. We have Precept upon Precept for the practice of this Duty of Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; <hi>Offer unto God Thankſgiving,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 50. 14. <hi>Let us come before his face with Thankſgiving,</hi> ſaith our Tranſlation; but the Original is <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>So here is forbidden, either malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to conceal, or arrogate to our ſelves, as our own purchace, what we have received of him: or elſe to detract that Duty, which in all reaſon, we are bound to perform, in that conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially, becauſe to Men we may go further, to ſome degree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence; but to God, there is the uttermoſt we can do, and therefore we ought to apply this to particulars, as in mentioning God's particular Favours to his Redeemed ones, to Travellers, to Captives, to Sick-men, to Sea-men; this is all he calls for: <hi>O that men would praiſe the Lord for his Goodneſs, and for his wonderful works to the Sons of men: Let them exalt him alſo in the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the people, and praiſe him in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the Elders.</hi> Pſal. 107. v. 13. 21. 3. 32.</p>

He holdeth our Soul in Life, when we think there is but a ſtep between us and Death, (as <hi>David</hi> thought, when he fled from <hi>Saul, 1 Sam. 20. 3.) and ſuffereth not our feet to be moved,</hi> Pſal. 66. 9. but according to his pleaſure, in <hi>whom we live, and move, and have our being,</hi> Acts 17. 28. as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks: <hi>The Manna that came from Heaven, was not reſtrained one day in forty years perambulation, and peregrination in the wilderneſs; thou with heldeſt not thy Manna from their mouth,</hi> ſaith <hi>Nehemiah, nor the water that flowed out of the rock, but gaveſt them water for their thirſt.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the many, and great provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of God's People, <hi>The Pillar of the

               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> How undeſerved are the Benefits we receive from God, that they may provoke us to Thankfulneſs, and how unexpected?</p>
            <p>We deſerve nothing but Wrath, and <hi>the curſe of Mount</hi> Ebal, Deut. 27. 13. or of <hi>Cain,</hi> Gen. 4. 11. or of our Father <hi>Adam,</hi> to whom it was ſaid, <hi>Curſed is the Earth for thy ſake, in ſorrow ſhalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy Life,</hi> Gen. 3. 17. If God ſhould deal with us according to our demerits, our beſt performances are but glorious Tranſgreſſions, <hi>and we are but unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servants at the beſt,</hi> as our Lord ſpeaks, Luk. 17. 10. <hi>Jacob</hi> pleads his Merit towards <hi>Laban</hi> ſtoutly, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. from <hi>v.</hi> 36. to <hi>v. 41. And</hi> Jacob <hi>was wroth, and chode with</hi> Laban; <hi>and</hi> Jacob <hi>anſwered, and ſaid to</hi> Laban, <hi>what is my Tranſgreſſion, or what is my ſin, that thou haſt ſo hotly purſued after me?</hi> And he ſtands upon his guard, and juſtifies himſelf, and challengeth <hi>Laban</hi> to lay to his Charge any unwarrantable A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in his <hi>twenty years ſervice, though he had changed his wages ten times,</hi> as the Prodigal's elder Brother ſaid to his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:43372:40"/> Father, <hi>Lo theſe many years do I ſerve thee, neither did I at any time tranſgreſs thy Commandment:</hi> Luc. 15. 29. But having to deal with God, he ſets a very low eſteem of himſelf, as not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the leaſt of God's Mercies; <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of all the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and of all the truth, which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy Servant; for with my ſtaff I paſſed over this</hi> Jordan, <hi>and now I am become two bands,</hi> Gen. 32. 10.</p>
            <p>See alſo the ſame dejection, and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial in his Grand-father <hi>Abraham: Behold now, I have taken upon me to ſpeak unto the Lord, who am but duſt and aſhes,</hi> Gen. 18. 23. and of <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> when <hi>David</hi> ſaid unto him, <hi>Fear not, for I will ſurely ſhew thee kindneſs, for</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan, <hi>thy Fathers ſake, and will reſtore thee all the Land of thy Father</hi> Saul, <hi>and thou ſhalt eat Bread at my Table continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: And he bowed himſelf, and ſaid, What is thy ſervant, that thou ſhouldſt look upon ſuch a dead Dog as I am?</hi> 2 Sam. 9. 8.</p>
            <p>The Mercies and Kindneſſes of all Men in the World, compared to God's undeſerved Favours, are but as a drop of a bucket of Water to the great Ocean: <hi>My thoughts are not as your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:43372:41"/> ſaith the Lord: For as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, ſo are my ways bigher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts,</hi> Iſa. 55. 8, 9. This Conſideration makes ſometimes the faithful ſo earneſt in the affection of joy, as they ſeem almoſt ridiculous in the Eyes of carnal Men, as <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal, when he danced before the Lord,</hi> 2 Sam. 6. 21. But their Juſtification is eaſie, it is before the Lord that I did it, to God's Glory, that I might expreſs my Thankfulneſs to him, and the joy of my Heart in doing him Service, whom, ſince the reſt know not, they are not to be reſpected if they ſcorn: nor is it to be wondred, if they be ſtrangely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it, as above the compaſs of their Conceit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> How without hope of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital are all, yea, the leaſt of God's benefits that call for Thankfulneſs; <hi>a cup of cold water only, given to drink in Chriſt's name, becauſe ye belong to Chriſt, ſhall not loſe a juſt, and ſuperabundant requital,</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. 41.</p>
            <p>See the full and final requital of all good and charitable Deeds, <hi>Matth. 25. 34, 35, 36. Come ye bleſſed of my
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:43372:41"/> Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world: For I was an hungry, and ye gave me meat, I was thirſty, and ye gave me drink, I was a ſtranger, and ye took me in, naked, and ye cloathed me, I was ſick, and ye viſited me, I was in prinſon, and ye came unto me.</hi> The Wicked he requites here, ſometimes in their own Coin, as <hi>Adoni bezek</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, <hi>when his thumbs and great toes were cut off: As I have done (to three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten Kings) ſo hath the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited me,</hi> Judg. 1. 7. We are all ready enough to requite Evil for Evil, to give him (<hi>quid pro quo</hi>) as good as he brings, as the Proverb rimes, as <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> ſerved the <hi>Philiſtines: As they have done unto me, ſo have I done unto them,</hi> Jud. 15. 11. But it being impoſſible to requite God in any thing, it is a moſt heinous Provocation of his juſtice, to render Evil for Good: <hi>Do ye thus provoke the Lord? O fooliſh people, and unwiſe!</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> with Aſtoniſhment and Abhorrency, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 6.</p>
            <p>'Tis left as a ſad blot in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Scutcheon, tho' otherwiſe a good Man, and a good King, by God's own Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: <hi>He truſted in the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſo that after him there was none

But</hi> Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah <hi>rendred not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up, therefore there was wroth upon him, and upon</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Jeruſalem, 2 Chr. 32. 25. For after the defeat of <hi>Senacherib</hi>'s Forces, <hi>by an Angel of God, that ſlew in one night an hundred four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and five thouſand men of war in the</hi> Aſſyrian <hi>Camp;</hi> and after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his Health, confirmed by a ſign from Heaven in the Sun's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trogradation by ten degrees, and the addition, by Patent from God, of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, to his days, with exceeding much Riches and Honour; yet for all this, he was not ſo careful to pleaſe God in an humble and thankful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of ſuch great Favours, as God was to pleaſure him in them all.</p>

            <p>Sir, Thus it is, you Princes, as well as other Folks be accomptable to God; as ariſe your Receipts to a higher propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo muſt your Allowances and Payments be greater or leſs. You will find in a greater Arrearage, when it comes to a reckoning, where much is beſtowed, much is called for again.</p>
            <p>Conſider, if your ſelf advance any Man above others, upon equal, and perhaps leſs deſert; if you do not think you ought more to repoſe in the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Loyalty of ſuch a one, be ye well ſure God looks for the like at your Hand: It behoves you therefore to be mindful of his Honour, which I dare

            <p>There is no need, that I deſcend to particulars, in general. I ſay, that God's King may not behave himſelf, as the remnant of Kings do; that are either <hi>Paganiſh,</hi> or <hi>Popiſh,</hi> that rule only for their own Pleaſures, and Appetites, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard of Juſtice, Peace, or Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, that preſume to make Religions of their own, to appoint a God, or any thing, as a ſervice of God, which he hath not commanded, which is to tye God to their baubles, as <hi>Jeroboam to the Golden Calves at</hi> Dan <hi>and</hi> Bethel, 1 Kin. 12. <hi>and</hi> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>to the Golden Image in the Plain of</hi> Dura, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. to appoint a ſervice in the Latin, whom the People underſtand not, contrary to the rule of <hi>Edification</hi> ſet down; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:43372:46"/> to reaſon of their biddings, under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Penalties; this is a tyranny againſt God. True it is, that Penal Laws may be made to bind, in many reſpects: But let Men beware, leſt they exact with greater ſeverity, obedience to their own Precepts, than God's; there is but one Law-giver, that can ſave and deſtroy, ſaith <hi>James</hi> 4. 12. when they forbid what God commands, and commands what God forbids; its Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, as did <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and other <hi>Heathen</hi> Emperors forbid to Circumciſe, to read the Law, <hi>and commanded to offer to Idols, and to eat Swines Fleſh, and all under pain of preſent Death,</hi> 2 Macc. 7.</p>

            <p>The like Expreſſions are in the Prayer for the whole State of Chriſt's Church Militant here on Earth.</p>
            <p>Let us deal plainly with God and our own Conſciences, and thoſe to whom theſe Prayers are recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, unleſs we think to pleaſe God, and Men, with a few fair words of Devotion, when our Heart is far from him, and the performance of theſe things we pray for, as the <hi>Eaſt</hi> is from the <hi>Weſt; Be not deceived</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle) God will not be mocked,</hi>

If we will not prevent theſe dangers, when we know what the late attempt to remove the occaſion of them coſt theſe Nations, that were ſore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and ſorely toſſed with the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of a long bloody War, and not fully comforted to this day.</p>

               <hi>Lord, put this heart in thoſe that have commanded us to put up thoſe ſweet words to God, in truth and ſimplicity of Heart,</hi> Amen. That we may not be ſaid <hi>to have a form of godlineſs,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 5. is an outward delineation of piety, of peace and unity, denying the power and practiſe of it, (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks) or as <hi>Jeremiah, They have healed the hurt of the Daughter of the my people ſlighted, ſaying, peace, peace, when there was no peace,</hi> Jer. 6. 14. and thoſe that are required to make their Addreſſes to God in theſe words, ſay, <hi>Haſt thou utterly rejected</hi> Judah? <hi>hath thy ſoul loathed</hi> Zion? <hi>why haſt thou ſmitten us, and there is no healing for us? we looked for peace, and there is no good, and for a time of healing, and behold trouble.</hi> Jer. 14. 19.

            <p>What God ſaid to <hi>David, Pſal. 2. This is my King;</hi> generally he ſaith it of all that be like to <hi>David,</hi> for he is the ſame.</p>

            <p>And without flattery, be it ſpoken, if God have any ſuch King in the World, it is our King, as he hath well declared, even by that very Argument of Protection, from ſuch villainous Practices, as were contrived againſt him, and ſuch eminent dangers, that he expoſed himſelf unto, both by Sea and Land, to them, that can, or will mark no other reaſon.</p>

            <p>And ſince our Liturgy that we read daily, is ſo full of good Prayers, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, and Requeſts for <hi>Peace,</hi> that God who is the Author of <hi>Peace,</hi> and lover of Concord, would give to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Unity, <hi>Peace,</hi> and Concord: Let this Charity begin at home, <hi>and let us, with our Apoſtle, follow after the things that make</hi> (moſt) <hi>for Peace, and the things wherewith we may edifie one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Rom. 14. 17, 19. and ye ſhall <hi>be named the Prieſts of the Lord, Men ſhall call you the Miniſters of our God, ye ſhall eat the Riches of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and in their Glory ſhall ye boast your ſelves,</hi> as the Evangelical <hi>Prophet</hi> ſpeaks, Iſa. 61. 6. leſt <hi>the Lord divide us in</hi> Jacob, <hi>and ſcatter us in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>as he did</hi> Simeon <hi>and</hi> Levi, <hi>that were Brethren in Evil,</hi> (but not in any good) to their perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

            <p>Again, our Brethren, that profeſs the ſame Faith of Chriſt crucified with us, yet diſſent from us in ſome Externals, and Circumſtances about Religion; lay to our charge, that we hang all our Religion, and Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon certain ſtinted Forms, and Canonical Offices, upon Perſons and Places, Times, Canonical Hours, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, Poſtures and Geſtures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that under the Fig-leaves of Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the worſhip of God, we cover all Iniquity, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth, whoſe whole Religion is nothing elſe, but a Congeries of ſuch inſipid ſtuff. And that of late, we were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, upon the advance of <hi>Popery,</hi> to turn <hi>Papiſts,</hi> rather than part with our Livings, perceiving ſome to be turned aſide already after <hi>Satan,</hi> like fallen Stars, and <hi>others with</hi> Demas, <hi>to forſake us, and embrace this preſent</hi> (Popiſh) <hi>World,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 10. and a great many in Church and State, ready to ſwim with the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            </p>
            <p>I dare not truſt my own Heart, when I think of <hi>Peter;</hi> but I hope there would be found, even among us, that enviouſly are ſtyled <hi>Conformiſts (tho' our Works are not found perfect before God,</hi> Apoc. 3. 2.) as many, and more, that would have laid down their Lives for the Word of God, and Teſtimony of Jeſus, as laid down their Livings, to avoid Men's Traditions and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; that they might not min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with the Fountain of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file the Waters of the <hi>Sanctuary.</hi> Such Imputations as theſe muſt needs cauſe <hi>the Ambaſſador of Peace to weep bitterly,</hi> as the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 7. But we expect better things of them, and accompanying, Salvation (that thus cenſures us) though they differ from us in the outward mode of Religion, which is various in all Countries, and speak
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43372:60"/> ill of us, <hi>our Mothers Children being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with us,</hi> Cant. 1. 6. <hi>They ſit and talk againſt their Brethren, and ſlander their own Mothers Sons,</hi> Pſal. 50. 20. <hi>we know that we are paſſed from Death to Life, becauſe we love the Brethren,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 14. <hi>and with Chriſt's Brethren, we hope to go to their Father, and our Father, to their God, and our God,</hi> Joh. 20. 17. <hi>with as ſincere Affection, and Brotherly Love,</hi> Gen. 33. 16. as <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſhewed, that was ſeparated from his Brethren for a while, <hi>that he might enjoy them for ever,</hi> Philem. 15.</p>
            <p>But beſides all this, they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe againſt many of us; <hi>that if throughly weighed, and laid in the ballance of the Sanctuary, would be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier than the Sand of the Sea,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi>'s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick Phraſe is, <hi>Job</hi> 6. 2, 3. That <hi>we leave our Flocks, and ſtarve them, being called by God and Man to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Goſpel, to no other end and purpoſe, but to feed them, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own Blood,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> Act. 20. 28. to the Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> in his laſt Viſitation at <hi>Miletus.</hi> And whereas it appears by the firſt verſe of the ſecond Chapter of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43372:60"/> this Epiſtle, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had never been among theſe of <hi>Coloſſae; that they had not ſeen his Face in the Fleſh,</hi> Col. 2. 1.</p>
            <p>It is to be marked how careful <hi>Paul</hi> was; that being now in Priſon at <hi>Rome,</hi> under the Bloody Tyrant <hi>Nero,</hi> when he might well have been excuſed from writing to other Churches, which himſelf had planted, yet takes no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to himſelf of eaſe, but writes, even to theſe that he had never ſeen, and <hi>had not ſeen his Face in the Fleſh;</hi> that if he could not, by reaſon of his Endurance, ſpeak to them, yet his Letter might inſtruct them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them in them in the truth of God; and what puniſhment ſhall they be worhty of, who being tied to ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Charges, have no regard to any thing, ſaving to the receiving of their Profits? As for the inſtruction of their Flocks; they think it enough to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low one <hi>Ten Pounds</hi> a Year, the Tenth part perhaps of the whole Living, to read them Prayers; and if they once or twice in a year ſhall come to them, and give them a Sermon, they think they have diſcharged their full Duty with advantage. I wonder how ſuch ſhould not bluſh, to hear of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43372:61"/> diligence, who is thus careful, even in his Priſon-houſe, and ſo far off, for thoſe he never ſaw: When they are thus careleſs for thoſe, whom by all Laws of God and Men, if not for Conſcience, yet for their Friends ſake, they ought to regard, and not task them out to Journey-men and Hirelings, <hi>but the Unjust knoweth no ſhame,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Zephaniah,</hi> Zeph. 3 5. <hi>and their own Shepherds pity them not,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Zephaniah,</hi> Zach. 11. 5. And to uſe the Phraſe of St. <hi>James</hi> in another Caſe, <hi>My Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, theſe things ought not ſo to be,</hi> Jam. 3. 10. and that of <hi>Job</hi> alſo in another Caſe, <hi>This is an heincus crime, yea, it is an Iniquity to be puniſhed by the Judges,</hi> Job 31. 11. and therefore it cries aloud to <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> for Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as much, if not more, than any common Nuſance whatſoever; yea, to God alſo (that ſees not as Man ſees) <hi>for Wrath and Indignation,</hi> that by a juſt reſentment of this common Error, practiced continually by a high Hand, <hi>His wrath may turn away from us,</hi> 2. Chron. 29. 10. as King <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> ſpeaks to his Miniſters: <hi>My Sons, be not negligent, be not now deceived,

The <hi>Prophet</hi> goes on to the 11th. <hi>verſe,</hi> with ſevere Comminations, that concern the Shepherds under the Goſpel (that are ſuch) as well as under the Law, for their Unfaithfulneſs to ſo great a truſt; being the greateſt under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, even no leſs, than the Souls of Men, <hi>redeemed with the precious Blood of Chriſt,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19.</p>
            <p>My Ground of this Application is, a Rule and Maxim of Philoſophy, and right Reaſon. <hi>Agente eodem modo exiſtente, &amp; eadem materiâ idem effectum.</hi> God changeth not, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43372:62"/> for this much, we are too impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if we deſire, or pretend more; therefore, as he <hi>puniſhed them for all their Iniquities,</hi> Am. 3. 2. from the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to this day, ſo hath he juſt cauſe to viſit us for our Iniquities, that are ſwoln to as great a bulk as they were before the laſt War: Give me leave to uſe here the words of <hi>Elihu</hi> to <hi>Job, At this my Heart trembleth, and is removed out of his place, Job</hi> 36. 1.</p>
            <p>Let us not flatter our ſelves upon the gracious Aſſiſtance we have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to found in our miraculous Reſtaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>An.</hi> 1660. which we could not have lookt for; no, not in a Dream, to be (after ſo many ſignal Defeats) on a ſudden, made more than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, with all the faults that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us, even forgetting that we had twenty Years time for repentance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us, to waſh us from our old Sins: <hi>Let us not be high-minded</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>but fear;</hi> indeed, <hi>If God be for us, who can be againſt us,</hi> ſaith the ſame <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> Rom. 8. 3.</p>

While he was thinking on theſe things with himſelf, the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſuddenly fled away, and the Air returned to its Serenity, and the Rays of the Sun being ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the Wood, he returned in ſafety: And having Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with the Queen that which had hapned to him, and calling for the Captive Damſel, he deſired to be inſtructed by her, how Chriſt ought to be worſhipped; and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling his Subjects together, he declares to them openly, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Benefits that befel him and his Wife; and although he was ſcarce initiated into the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet he commands all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to embrace the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, and perſwades them all to worſhip Chriſt: He prevails with the Men, and the Queen and the Captive Chriſtian Maid with the Women: Thus in a marvellous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by God's Bleſſing, and the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:43372:84"/> Queen's Exhortation, the King and the Nation of the <hi>Iberians</hi> was brought over from <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> to the Faith of Chriſt.</q> Thus far are the words of <hi>Sozomen,</hi> where we may alſo read of a great Miracle, that hapned at the building of a Church, at the Prayers of this Captive, by which the Faith of the <hi>Iberians</hi> was much more confirmed, than by the foregoing Miracles.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>If the Peace of God rule in our Hearts, into which we are called in one Body by Chriſt, whom God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be head over all things to the Church, which is his Body, the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all,</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 22, 23.
